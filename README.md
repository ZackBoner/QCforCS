Repository for managing the code I write as I work through the textbook Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists by Yanofsky and Mannucci.
I have made an effort to write decent code in an object oriented structure, although I have neglected stringent testing as it really isn't in the spirit of this textbook's exercises.

Chapter 1: Explore complex numbers and the operations you can perform on them.
The code in this section is not re-used, since Python's implemented complex data type is better suited for use inside of numpy arrays.

Chapter 2: Explore complex vector spaces.
The ComplexVector class and the adjacent static methods are re-used frequently.

Chapter 3: Compare and contrast the double slit experiment performed with a bullet vs. a photon.

Chapter 4: Explore quantum systems in greater detail.
